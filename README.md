# üí´ About Me:
I recently graduated from Law and am looking to transfer into all things tech after completing a 13-week intensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp.<br><br>You might be wondering why I am daring to make such a transition, or not (if you don't know me yet just know you've dodged the ramblings of a young and hopefully not naive 21-year-old about her future hopes for law, tech and society). <br>If you're like, really cool, and could spare me a few minutes of your extremely busy schedule, feel free to drop me a message on linked in @jannahanwar.<br>I'd love to absorb everything you tell me like a sponge and go forth feeling enlightened like Po in Kung Fu Panda.<br><br>I am currently starting a Masters in Data Science, and am soon to be working to be working on my first hackathon targeted at harnessing AI to create a more inclusive workplace, oooooo exciting!<br><br> I‚Äôm looking for help with navigating and breaking into the tech industry to land my first developer role and eventually recreate anything close to the apple website. What a beauty.
